The sheer number of murder cases can quickly become overwhelming to resolve especially when simultaneously keeping the remainder of your herd healthy and happy in production. Fear no more: I will show you the techniques, structures and processes which we have adopted at Giant Swarm through thousands of postmortems. The best practices presented here will help you efficiently solve murders with the precision of a top tier medical examiner while also improving the health of the rest of your cattle. I will additionally showcase some of the most grizzly murders we have encountered and how we dissected them; all for your entertainment of course.
